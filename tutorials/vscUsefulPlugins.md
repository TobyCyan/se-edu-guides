**The plugin helps mainly by,**

1.  **stylising the Markdown text in-place** (e.g., bold text is shown as bold) so that you get some sense of the formatting you are using, as is shown on the left side of the screenshot above.
1. **showing a preview of how the page will be rendered** in HTML, as shown on the right side of the screenshot above.

### Installing the plugin

1. Open the **Extensions sidebar** in VS Code.
2. Search for **‘Markdown All in One’ by Yu Zhang**.
3. Click `Install`.

You should now see a new preview option when working with Markdown files.
