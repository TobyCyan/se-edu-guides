# Sourcetree

[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is a free GUI client for Git. In this guide, we assume you are using it with a GitHub account.

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## Installation

1. Download Sourcetree from [their website](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) and run it.
1. When prompted to `Login to your Atlassian account`, you can try to skip that step. If the installer doesn't allow skipping, you can create an Atlassian account as directed.
1. In the next step, you will be prompted to `Connect an Account`. ==Choose to skip== (we'll be connecting Sourcetree to GitHub later).
1. In the `Pick tools to download and install`, you will be asked to choose whether to install Git and <tooltip content="another revision control software similar to Git">Mercurial</tooltip>. Unselect Mercurial. Assuming you have installed Git already, when prompted, choose to use the system Git instead of the Git that come with Sourcetree.
1. If prompted to set up an SSL key, you can click `No`, but you are free to set of an SSL key if you are familiar with SSL key usage.
1. Now you can proceed to connect Sourcetree to your GitHub account, as explained in the sections below.

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## Connecting Sourcetree to Your GitHub Account

### On Windows

**Option 1:** This is the recommended option, as it caters for both basic and advanced usage.

1. Create a _classic_ (not fine-grained) GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT), by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).<br>
   When asked to select the scope of the PAT, you can choose the `repo` option and the `workflow` option.
1. In the Sourcetree, choose `Tools` -> `Options` -> `Authentication`
1. If any GitHub authentication methods are shown in that dialog, delete them.
1. Click on `Add`, to add an authentication method.
1. In the next dialog, choose:
   * Hosting Service: `GitHub`
   * Preferred Protocol: `HTTPS`
   * Authentication: `Personal Access Token`
1. Click on the `Refresh Personal Access Token` button. When prompted, enter your usual GitHub username but ==give the PAT (the one you created in step 1) instead of the regular password==.
1. Now, your Sourcetree should be able to push code to a GitHub repo that you have write permission to.

**Option 2:** This option is good enough for basic usage.

1. Authenticate with your default browser on your GitHub account with your normal GitHub username/password.
1. In the SourceTree, choose `Tools` -> `Options` -> `Authentication`
1. If any GitHub authentication methods are shown in that dialog, delete them.
1. Click on `Add`, to add an authentication method.
1. In the next dialog, choose:
   * Hosting Service: `GitHub`
   * Preferred Protocol: `HTTPS`
   * Authentication: `OAuth`
1. Click on the `Refresh OAuth token` button.<br>
   If a Browser Window pops up and asks you to log in to GitHub and to authorize Sourcetree accessing your GitHub account, do so.
1. Now, your Sourcetree should be able to push code to a GitHub repo that you have write permission to.


**Option 3:**

1. [Open the Windows Credential Manager](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0).
2. For each credential related to GitHub (if the name mentions GitHub) in `Web Credentials` or `Windows Credentials` categories,<br>
   (a) edit it and replace the password field with a GitHub PAT.<br>
   (b) If the above didn't work, delete those credential altogether and try Option 1 or 2 again.

### On a Mac

Given below are two options for connecting Sourcetree with your GitHub account. Both requires creating a Personal Access Token (PAT) at some point. When you do crete a PAT, we recommend that you ==tick both `repo` and `workflow` checkboxes==.

* **Option 1:** Try the stepts given in this YouTube guide from Nick Graham:

<p/>

* **Option 2:** If the above doesn't work, try this guide (from Medium): [Using Sourcetree to connect to GitHub without password](https://medium.com/geekculture/using-personal-access-token-in-sourcetree-to-connect-to-github-3702a29554d3).<br>
It gives two methods. Recommended to try method 2 first.

<box header="Caching GitHub credentials" type="tip" seamless>

If you are prompted to enter GitHub credentials everytime you connect to GitHub using Sourcetree, you can cache GitHub credentials by following the guide given [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git?platform=mac) (recommended: use the Git Credentials Manager option, not the GitHub CLI option).
